        "You will turn now to a fundamental property of language: the relationship between a token's frequency and its rank. After counting all the unique tokens in the Africa Galore dataset, you can rank them, giving rank 1 to the most frequent token, rank 2 to the second most frequent, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "You might assume this distribution is random, but languages consistently follow a predictable pattern. A very small number of tokens (like \"the\", \"a\", \"and\") are extremely common, while the vast majority are rare, often appearing only once. This creates a \"long tail\" distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you tried to plot this relationship on a standard scale, the result would be unreadable. The few hyper-frequent tokens would dominate the chart, while the thousands of rare tokens would be squashed into an indistinguishable area at the bottom. The range in frequencies makes it impossible to see the underlying pattern clearly.\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve this, you will use a **log-log plot**. By plotting the logarithm of the rank against the logarithm of the frequency, you can manage this range. A logarithmic scale compresses the distance between large values and expands the distance between small ones. This rescaling results in a much clearer view of the entire dataset at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "Run the following cell to compute this log-log plot."

        "Zipf's law highlights a core challenge in the processing of texts. The law guarantees that any text corpus will be dominated by a small number of very frequent tokens, while the vast majority of the vocabulary will be extremely rare. This \"long tail\" of infrequent tokens is a major hurdle for building language models. If a model encounters a token only a handful of times in a large dataset, it will be challenging to learn its meaning. This is a fundamental problem that AI researchers must address when training models. In the next activities, you will encounter tokenization methods that allow models to extract more meaning from very rare tokens."

        "The character-level tokenizer vocabulary is much smaller compared to word-level tokenizer vocabulary. For character-level tokenization, the vocabulary is usually small because there are only a limited number of characters in any given language. For example, English has characters like A, B, C, etc., while Arabic has Alif, Ba, Tha (أ, ب, ت). All these characters are considered tokens in a character-level tokenizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Words, on the other hand, are far more diverse. Think about the vocabulary of the English language. This has been estimated to include approximately one million words [2]. That is orders of magnitude more than the number of characters used in English. In other languages with more complex writing systems such as Chinese, the difference between the number of unique characters and the number of unique words may be smaller but still substantial.\n",

Models trained on word-level tokens require many more parameters but, at least for common words, generally learn much better meaning representations."
