        "In the previous activity, you saw how a model can learn from **noise** in the training data. This lab builds on that concept using the transformer model you previously trained on the Africa Galore dataset. Here, you will investigate how the duration of training affects the balance between learning useful patterns (signal) and undesirable ones (noise).\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall that in the first course \"01 Build Your Own Small Language Model\" you learned that transformer language models are trained by repeatedly comparing their predictions for a context to the actual next token in the training data. This process is repeated for every token in the training data and often, the model goes through the training data multiple times as part of the training process. Each iteration through the training data is an epoch.\n",
        "\n",
        "During each epoch, the model updates its parameters in order to minimize a loss function that indicates how much the model predictions deviate from the targets. In general, if the model is learning well, the loss therefore decreases with each epoch, as you have observed when you trained a language model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will prompt different small language models that have been trained on noisy data for varying numbers of epochs. As you will observe, one of the models did not learn any patterns, another one learned both useful and undesirable patterns, and the third one, primarily learned useful patterns.\n",

It learned the useful pattern that \"of\" generally appears after phrases such as \"a symbol\" or \"a vibrant symbol\" (signal), and it did not learn patterns specific to the training data (noise). This means it was able to learn more abstract patterns, which allows it to **generalize** to new siuations.\n",
