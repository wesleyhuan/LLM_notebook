        "In this lab, you will focus on essential **preprocessing techniques** for text data. The lab builds on the 'Exploring raw data' activity that you undertook in the previous module. Here, you manually prepared the data. Now, you will learn how to prepare the data for tokenization programmatically.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Large language models (LLMs) are often trained on vast publically available datasets sourced from the web. The sheer volume of data provides enough examples so that the models can average out imperfections, enabling them to still learn the underlying patterns. This volume acts as a buffer, enabling the models to identify underlying patterns and relationships even when individual data points may be erroneous, incomplete, or noisy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even when language models are large, data preprocessing is essential for text data sourced from the internet. This is because raw text data often contains irrelevant characters, inconsistencies, or formatting issues that can hinder model performance. You will first explore how to identify and remove HTML tags and entities from snippets of internet data. You will then be introduced to Unicode characters. Text data is not always written in standard Latin letters and numbers and Unicode provides a way to represent all types of characters, including complex ones such as symbols and emojis. Once you have learned how to preprocess data by removing HTML tags, you will remove emoji Unicode characters from a short piece of text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, your goal is to reduce noise while still keeping important information. Striking this balance is key to building models that are not only accurate but also **aligned with user expectations**. Every cleaning decision you make shapes your data and the behaviors your model will learn from it."

For your task of stripping HTML tags from raw text, you can use a regular expression to create a pattern that precisely identifies the structure of any HTML tag, which typically starts with a `<` and ends with a `>`. In Python, you will use the built-in [`re` module](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howto) to apply this pattern. By using a function like `re.sub()`, you can instruct Python to find all substrings in your raw text that match this HTML tag pattern and replace them with an empty string (`\"\"`). This effectively deletes the tags and leaves you with only the clean, human-readable content.\n",
